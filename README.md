# fitbit

This project was done as a CSE 132 (Computer Science II) class project. Using a Arduino Uno Board and Java & Arduino C, a user can create a fitbit-like device that can track steps and their speed. The device can also read temperature, record time of sleep, and record runtime.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
